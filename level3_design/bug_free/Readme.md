# The following is the report on bug free design the design under consideration is 32-bit vedic multiplier


1. The follwing is the snap of repository:

2. Verification environment:

The following is the verification environment for functional verification of 32-bit vedic multiplier

RTL is developed for vedic multiplication using Verilog HDL and the test environment is using python

assert statement is used to compare the RTL design's output with high level model using python


3. Test scenario:

4. Design bug:

Since this is the bug free case there is match between RTL design and python model
